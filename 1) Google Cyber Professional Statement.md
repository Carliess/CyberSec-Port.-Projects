I am a curious and always learning cybersecurity analyst, that is detail orientated and very personable. 
I value earning the trust and rapport within my teams, and using integrity and customer obsession to ensure the security, confidentiality, and availibility of my clients.
As a Cybersecurity Analyst, it satisfies my interest in technology and desire to uphold the morality that a CS Analyst actively works against.
